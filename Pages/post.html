                <h3>Learn Web Development In The Easiest Way</h3>
                <P>How can I start learning web development? Is it easy? And how can I keep up with the latest web designing technologies?
                   These are the questions that appear in every beginner’s mind. There is also confusion between web designing and web 
                   development, but we’ll talk about web development.It totally depends on how much you are interested in and are serious 
                   about it. if you desperately wanted to learn then you can easily be an expert on it. There’s nothing like it’s so hard or 
                   something like it’s so difficult to design websites like we use or look around our day-to-day life. e.g: Facebook, Google, 
                   Amazon, Flipkart, Snapdeal, and many more.
                   <br><br>
                   But if we really think about it, Scaring is natural, comes to mind when we look at it as a bunch of graphical elements like 
                   different colors, different kind of fonts, images, Card views, Tables, Animations, etc. and the most interesting one is the 
                   term called ‘Responsive’ websites, responsive websites are those websites which change it’s element’s alignments, spacing, 
                   etc according to the device it’s browsing. But nowadays it’s not a very hard concept anymore, you can easily design your 
                   website responsive with the help of some predefined libraries, we have so many types of frameworks available for designing 
                   web sites and the best thing is that it’s all freely available to use, you just need to learn ‘How to use it’. Now if you 
                   are wondering about how to learn it then just don’t worry about it. I am sharing one of the best sources available on the 
                   Internet to learn all these things freely and easily, you just need to follow it and practice it own.
                   <br><br>
                   Waw! it’s really dame true, to learn website designing web is the best place you will ever have. It will be something 
                   like you no need to study theory concepts of something first then do the practice of that, what actually we all do 
                   during our academics. You will learn the concept with the whole details about the effect of that learning. You will 
                   see all different kind of things that developed day by day and when you will observe it, you want to do it yourself 
                   which emphasis you to learn more day by day. You will be always engaged with the field you are working on. Let’s start 
                   learning Web.
                   <br><br>
                   Stages to follow:
                   <br><br>
                   Stage 1 – HTML: HTML, you have heard about it lots of times before. If I am not wrong HTML is the language you have 
                   learned in your school life. Yes, it’s actually the same as what you have learned a long time ago but as long as time 
                   changes technologies are changes. Nowadays as you have grown up, even HTML has been grown up too, now there is called 
                   HTML5 which comes into existence. What? Worried about what is it? Don’t be. I just said that as we have grown up HTML 
                   has grown up too but the difference between us and HTML is, it changed its name to HTML5. In HTML5, you can not just 
                   prepare the basic structure of the web page but we have many more things that we can do. We can store and process values 
                   on variables on-page itself without any databases as we do in any programming languages (Temporary variables), we can 
                   develop games on it. No need for the flash to play animations on it. Even we can develop a fully functional blog with 
                   HTML4 itself without any help to server-side scripting languages.
                   <br>
                   Stage 2 – CSS: We live in such a society where everybody wants to look pretty, beautiful, to achieve this everyone does 
                   makeup. Similarly, CSS does for HTML. CSS creates the beauty on HTML pages. With the help of CSS, you can make your web 
                   page colorful and smooth. You can even create animations using CSS. You can add transitions, changing the scrolling events 
                   of your pages, mouse click events and many more. But as HTML changes to HTML5, CSS also has been changed to CSS3.
                   <br>
                   Stage 3 – JAVASCRIPT: You have learned how your site will look like, you have designed the beauty of your page yet. Now, 
                   it’s turn to create some useful tasks that your web page elements will do when some activities performed on your web pages 
                   like button click events, mouse over any text, playing and pausing some animations on page, etc. With the help of JAVASCRIPT, 
                   you can do that easily. One of the best scripting languages used to make a web page more smooth, flexible and platform-
                   independent is javascript. It’s not that easy to learn but whatever you learned at an easy level, that will be enough to do 
                   your all tasks.
                   <br>
                   Stage 4 – BOOTSTRAP: Remember the term Responsive ? Okay, let me explain to you what exactly responsive website means. 
                   Responsive websites are those sites which change its element’s alignments, spacing according to the screen size of the 
                   device it is browsing. This is the technology called Bootstrap which makes it easier to design a responsive web site. 
                   Bootstrap is an open-source front end framework that works with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to design responsive web sites 
                   for your laptops, tablets and mobile devices.
                   <br>
                   Stage 5 – PHP: As up to now you have learned about how your web page will look like, how the interface of your web page 
                   users will face. How it reacts based upon the user’s activity but only at the client machine. But nowadays we have the works 
                    a lot perform on the back end of our web page called server. So to code on server-side we need server-side scripting language 
                    which one is PHP (Hypertext Preprocessor). We have also many more other server-side scripting languages are there like Asp.net, 
                    JSP etc but PHP is one of the easiest and most used server-side scripting languages.
                    <br>
                    Stage 6 – MySQL: Now it comes to databases, We have so many data available to display on the web page but we just can’t 
                    simply store them on web pages. A database management system is important because it manages data efficiently and allows 
                    users to perform multiple tasks with ease. A database management system stores organizes and manages a large amount of 
                    information within a single software application. MY-SQL is one of the open-source database management available in the IT 
                    industry. I am recommending learning PHP language instead of ASP and JSP just because it provides easiest way to connect 
                    MY-SQL database with it If you have a basic concept of C/C++ Programming languages. Even you can practice the connectivity 
                    of PHP and MY-SQL on your local machine with the help of tools discussed above.
                    <br><br>
                    Advance Technologies to Learn: Why should you learn advanced technologies? Obviously, this question will be arising in 
                    your mind. It’s absolutely true that you can develop a fully functional website with a well designed front end and a good 
                    performance back end but what if you want to design such a web site like Amazon, Flipkart, Google, Microsoft, Facebook, 
                    Snapdeal, OLX, etc. Those websites are not just using the above languages, tools but they use more than these technologies 
                    that I am going to explain to you as below.
